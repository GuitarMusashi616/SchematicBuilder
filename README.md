Instructions: 
  ```In Lua IDE Clone Main Repository and run NBTBuilder.lua in source folder```
 
Use in game:
  ```Or in Direwolf20 1.12 Minecraft Modpack (or any ~1.12 pack with OpenComputers) 
    Create a OpenCC Robot with basics + Inventory_Controller + Angel_Block upgrade
      Optional include Crescent Hammer Tool + Hover upgrade + Internet Card
    In Robot, after installing OpenOS, type in "pastebin run Di9bhf9p" to download all relevant files```
   
    ```to download schematics from main/schematics run "/build/utils/download <schematicFilename>" eg. "/build/utils/download Medieval2"
    
    before building put all building blocks in a chest under the Robot
    to start building type in "/build/NBTbuilder <schematicFilename>"
    
    schematics can also be download from minecraft-schematics.com (or planetminecraft.com or any site with schematics)

      this can be done by uploading the file online and running "wget <url> /build/<filename>" in the robot```
